Problem statement :       Tourism simplified through voice   
                        
    Alexa is Amazon’s cloud base voice service, that helps users interact with brands, data, and 
    business logic through voice.
                        
    Use Alexa to innovate, and build the next generation of interfaces for tourists in India.
                        
    Your solution should help solve pain points of tourists coming to India like - voice forums to crowd 
    source destination reviews, GPS based voice navigators to guide tourists at historical sites, 
    SOS and emergency support solutions for local and international travelers, travel guides with entry 
    prerequisites, government policies, visa needs, and recommendations on seasons to visit.
                        
    The Alexa based solution should be intuitive to the physically challenged travelers in India.
