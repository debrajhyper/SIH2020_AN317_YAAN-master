Problem statement :       Tourism simplified through voice   
                        
    Alexa is Amazon’s cloud base voice service, that helps users interact with brands, data, and business logic through voice.
                        
    Use Alexa to innovate, and build the next generation of interfaces for tourists in India.
                        
    Your solution should help solve pain points of tourists coming to India like - voice forums to crowd source destination reviews, 
    GPS based voice navigators to guide tourists at historical sites, SOS and emergency support solutions for local and 
    international travelers, travel guides with entry prerequisites, government policies, visa needs, and 
    recommendations on seasons to visit.
                        
    The Alexa based solution should be intuitive to use also cater to the physically challenged travelers in India.
